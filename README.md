## What I learned 
This assignment was my first time ever coding so I learned quite a lot. Firstly I learned the simple functions of both CSS and HTML languages. Things like applying a grid, placing images, changing colors, effects on my hover button and just the general demystifying of how websites are built. Secondly I learned about the importance of accessibility. I used Adobe contrast checker to ensure that my colors for text and graphics met the necessary standards. I also learned the use of alt text and while not much is in this code knowing its use and how to apply it will definitely be important in other codes. 

## Overall experience
This was definitely a challenge but was satisfying when I was able to get things to actually work (despite the cursor I dont know whats wrong), the biggest challenge definitely was planning what I wanted it to look like. I had never done much personal branding and knowing I didn't have the skills to do extravagant code definitely created a block. Ultimately though I designed that I would keep it minimalistic and focus on understanding how it works over how it looks. I also just like the way my colors are relatively calming but still draw attention and how the size of my name makes a statement.
